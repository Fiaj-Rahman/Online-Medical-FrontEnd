# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

MedConnect is an innovative online healthcare platform designed to facilitate seamless doctor-patient interactions. The platform enables patients to book appointments with their preferred doctors for online consultations and treatments. Doctors can apply to join MedConnect via a dedicated application page. Once submitted, applications are reviewed and approved by the admin or HR team. Upon approval, doctors are listed on the platform, where patients can choose and schedule appointments.

MedConnect also includes a blog feature where doctors can publish health tips and advice, providing valuable information to patients. SSLCommerz payment gateway integration ensures secure online transactions for booking appointments. Patients must complete the payment process before securing an appointment with their chosen doctor. Upon successful payment, doctors receive a notification and can share appointment details, including the time, date, and Google Meet link for the consultation. Patients are notified of the confirmed appointment, and the treatment session is conducted as scheduled.

The platform is built with a robust tech stack to ensure smooth functionality and scalability. Key technologies used include:

### **Frontend:**
- **React.js** for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Firebase** for real-time data management and authentication.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and modern UI design.
- **Heroicons/react, React FontAwesome, @mui/icons-material** for UI components and icons.
- **AOS** for smooth scrolling animations.
- **Axios** for making HTTP requests.
- **React-Router-Dom** for efficient navigation and routing.
- **React-Toastify** for providing in-app notifications.
- **Slick-Carousel, Swiper** for image and content carousels.
- **Sweetalert2** for interactive alert dialogs.

### **Backend:**
- **Express.js & Node.js** for building the server-side logic and handling API requests.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure authentication and user session management.
- **Web3Form** for handling Contact message submissions.
- **SSLCommerz** for secure payment processing.
- **MongoDB** for storing user and appointment data.
- **Nodemailer** for sending emails (e.g., appointment confirmations).
- **Bcrypt** for secure password hashing.
- **Cookie-parser** for handling cookies.
- **Cors** for managing cross-origin requests.

MedConnect's architecture is optimized for performance, security, and user experience, providing both patients and doctors with a reliable platform for telemedicine services. Continuous updates and improvements are planned to enhance functionality and further improve user satisfaction.
